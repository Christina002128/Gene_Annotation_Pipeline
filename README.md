# Gene_Annotation_Pipeline
<br>import gene expression data, gene annotation, sample annotation, normalize data, generate heatmap and explain the result.

Heatmap 1: both the genes and the samples are clustered. We are interesting in the gene expression between samples, so scale equals to “row”.

Heatmap 2: only the genes are clustered.

Outline the interpretation of the heatmap plots
From the sample clustering, we can see that samples that conducted same treatment show similar gene expression patterns. In addition, the expression patterns of treatment 2 and 3 show great similarities, while expression pattern of treatment 4 is significantly different from expression patterns of other groups.
From the gene type clustering, we can see that genes that are in the same type don’t cluster together, which reveals that the expression patterns of genes in same type doesn’t necessarily to be similar. Moreover, we can see that some genes shows similar changes across different treatments. The expression of genes significantly changed between treatments can become biomarker, showing the biological changes when those treatments are conducted.
